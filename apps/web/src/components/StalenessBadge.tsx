/**
 * Renders the `readModelAsOf`/`live` pair every analytics response carries.
 * Staleness in this platform is a disclosed property, not a
 * hidden one — no analytics figure is rendered anywhere in this dashboard
 * without this badge next to it.
 *
 * `readModelAsOf` is nullable for the two lagged widgets: it reads
 * reporting_outbox_cursor.updated_at, which has no row until apps/reporting
 * has completed its first pass. That case renders as an explicit "reporting
 * worker has not run yet" rather than as an Invalid Date — a dashboard that
 * quietly showed empty rollups with no explanation would be exactly the kind
 * of hidden staleness this badge exists to prevent.
