/**
 * A UI-only convenience gate. It is **explicitly not** the security boundary
 * for anything it wraps.
 *
 * Most of what this hides is also gated server-side by the route's own
 * `requireMerchantRole(...)` — payment-link create/cancel, every webhook
 * route, the reconciliation report. Capture and void are the deliberate
 * exception: the API gates them at "any authenticated merchant actor" with no
 * narrower role check, so hiding them from `support` here is a UX choice
 * (a support agent's job is to look things up, not move money) and nothing
 * more. That divergence is called out at the call site too, so nobody
 * mistakes the hidden button for a boundary it isn't.
 *
 * Hence the deliberate default: when the current role is unknown (the `me`
 * call hasn't resolved), `children` are shown, not hidden. Hiding on
 * uncertainty would quietly turn this into the thing deciding access. The
 * server's `403` is the answer; `describeError` renders it plainly when it
 * comes back.
