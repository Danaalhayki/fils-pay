 * Writes one `admin_audit_log` row.
 *
 * This function takes a `PoolClient`, never a `Pool`, and that is the entire
 * point of its signature: it is *impossible* to call outside an open
 * transaction, so every call site is forced to co-locate the audit insert
 * with the action's own writes in one atomic unit. Nothing here catches
 * anything — a failed insert propagates, and because the caller is inside
 * `withTransaction`, it rolls the action back with it.
 *
 * There is deliberately no pool-accepting overload, no `try { } catch { }`,
 * and no "log and continue" path. An admin action that succeeds without an
 * audit row must not be reachable, and the way to guarantee that is to make
 * the unaudited call impossible to write rather than merely discouraged.
 *
 * For an action that crosses a process boundary — settlement re-run,
 * balance rebuild — a Postgres transaction cannot span the outbound HTTP
 * call, so those handlers commit this row *before* making the call (so the
 * record that the action was attempted always predates the risk) and then
 * use `markAdminAuditOutcome` to record how it ended.
